## Additional Libraries Used

  - "@material-ui/core" - I chose to use Material UI's ready-made components, grid system and typography for this project.
  - "@material-ui/lab" - The filters are all autocompletes so the user can narrow down the suggestions. Autocomplete is a part of the Material UI Lab.
  -  "axios" - For fetching the data from the API.
  -  "node-sass" - I prefer to use .scss in styling.
